Privacy Policy for BusyRN

Last Updated: October 29, 2025

Introduction

BusyRN (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. BusyRN is designed to operate completely offline, without any internet or server connection. This means no user data is ever sent, shared, or transmitted outside your device.

This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled locally within the BusyRN mobile application (“App”).

Key Principle: 100% Local Processing

BusyRN does not connect to the internet.

The app does not use or require any online accounts or cloud storage.

All features work entirely on your device, and any data generated stays only on your phone.

Because the app never transmits data, no one (including us) can access your information.

Information We Handle Locally
1. Call Information

What: Caller details, timestamps, and call outcomes (blocked/allowed).

Why: To apply your call screening rules and show filtered call logs.

Storage: Stored locally on your device only.

Sharing: Never shared or sent anywhere — the app cannot transmit this data externally.

2. Contacts Information

What: Temporary access to your contacts list.

Why: To identify favorite or known contacts when filtering calls.

Storage: Used only in real time; not saved after use.

Sharing: Never shared or uploaded.

3. SMS Functionality

What: Permission to send automatic SMS replies.

Why: To send auto-reply messages to blocked callers according to your preferences.

Storage: BusyRN does not read, store, or analyze SMS messages.

Sharing: Never shared, as the app functions offline.

Permissions We Request

BusyRN requests only the permissions required for local operation:

READ_PHONE_STATE: To detect and manage incoming calls.

READ_CONTACTS: To identify known contacts for filtering.

SEND_SMS: To send automatic SMS replies to blocked callers.

RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: To restart call filtering after a device reboot.

FOREGROUND_SERVICE: To keep the call screening service running.

POST_NOTIFICATIONS: To display status updates in the notification bar.

These permissions are used solely for the described purposes and never for data collection or tracking.

Data Storage and Security

All information stays entirely on your device.

BusyRN does not use internet connectivity for any feature.

No external servers, no cloud sync, no analytics, and no third-party data collection are involved.

You can permanently remove all data at any time by uninstalling the app.

Your Rights

You have full control over your information:

Access and view call logs within the app.

Delete all stored data by uninstalling the app.

Withdraw permissions at any time in your device settings.

Use BusyRN without sharing any personal data beyond what’s processed locally for functionality.

Children’s Privacy

BusyRN is not intended for children under 13 years of age. The app does not knowingly collect or store any data from children, and since it operates offline, no information is transmitted.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect app updates or legal requirements. Any changes will appear here with an updated “Last Updated” date.

Would you like me to format this version for Google Play Store compliance (including “Data Safety” section entries that match this privacy policy)? It can save time when you submit your app.
