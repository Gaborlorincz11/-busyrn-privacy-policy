🛡️ BusyRN – Smart Call Manager for Android 14+

Tired of unwanted calls interrupting your day?
BusyRN is your intelligent, privacy-first call manager designed for professionals, creators, and anyone who values peace and focus.

Built natively for Android 14+, BusyRN automatically filters, rejects, or silences incoming calls based on your personal preferences — and even sends automatic SMS replies so you never leave important contacts waiting.

This isn’t another shady data-harvesting app. BusyRN stores everything locally on your device, with no cloud accounts, no tracking, and no third-party servers — ever. Your call data stays yours.

Full Control, Zero Noise – BusyRN works quietly in the background once set as your default call manager.

🔒 Privacy You Can Trust

BusyRN is built with local-first architecture — meaning all your contacts, call rules, and logs are stored safely on your phone.
No external servers, analytics SDKs, or background data transfers.
We don’t collect, upload, or share any personal information.

Unlike many “free” call apps, BusyRN is a paid app because your privacy should never be the price.

⚙️ How It Works

Once installed and set as your default Call Screening App, BusyRN automatically checks incoming calls against your personalized rules.
Depending on your preferences, it can:

Allow trusted contacts to ring normally

Silence unknown or non-urgent numbers

Instantly reject spam or unwanted calls

Send automatic “I’m busy right now” SMS responses

Setup takes less than a minute — after that, BusyRN works quietly in the background while you stay focused on what matters.
