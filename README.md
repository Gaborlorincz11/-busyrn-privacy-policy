 BusyRN - User Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the App
```bash
flutter build apk
flutter install -d bdb1ca32
```

### Step 2: Launch and Grant Permissions
1. Open the **BusyRN** app
2. You'll see the **Permissions screen** automatically
3. Grant each permission:
   - ‚úÖ **Phone Permission** - Tap "Grant Permission" button
   - ‚úÖ **Contacts Permission** - Tap "Grant Permission" button
   - ‚úÖ **Call Screening Role** - Tap "Grant Permission" button (this will open a system dialog)

### Step 3: Set as Default Call Screening App ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

**This is the most important step!** Without this, the app won't screen any calls.

#### Method 1: Via System Dialog (Easiest)
When you tap "Grant Permission" for Call Screening Role, Android will show a dialog asking you to set BusyRN as the default. **Tap "Set as default"**.

#### Method 2: Manual Setup (If dialog was missed)
1. Open **Android Settings**
2. Go to **Apps** ‚Üí **Default apps**
3. Tap **Call screening app** (or **Phone app** ‚Üí **Call screening**)
4. Select **BusyRN**
5. Confirm

#### Method 3: Via Permissions Screen
1. In BusyRN, tap **"Request Call Screening Role"** button
2. When system dialog appears, grant it

### Step 4: Verify Setup
1. Return to BusyRN app
2. Home screen should show:
   - üü¢ **"Protection Active"** status
   - Toggle should be ON and enabled
3. If you see üü† **"Protection Inactive"**, the Call Screening Role wasn't granted properly

### Step 5: Configure Rules
1. Tap **"Manage Rules"** on home screen
2. You'll see 4 default rules:
   - **Always Allow Favorites** (Priority 0) - ‚úÖ Enabled
   - **Block Unknown at Night** (Priority 1) - ‚úÖ Enabled  
   - **Block Hidden Numbers** (Priority 2) - ‚ùå Disabled
   - **Allow All Contacts** (Priority 3) - ‚úÖ Enabled

3. Toggle rules ON/OFF, or create new rules

### Step 6: Test It!
1. Have someone call you from a number that's NOT in your favorites
2. If it's night time (22:00-07:00), the call should be rejected
3. Check **View Call Logs** to see the call and action taken

---

## üìä Understanding Call Logs

The **Call Logs** screen shows every call that was screened:

- **Green check** = Allowed (rang normally)
- **Red block** = Rejected (sent to voicemail)
- **Orange mute** = Silenced (rang without sound)
- **Blue voicemail** = Sent to voicemail

Each log shows:
- Phone number (or "Unknown Number")
- Action taken
- Whether caller was in contacts/favorites
- Time of call

You can refresh logs or clear them using the buttons at the top.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Call Screening Works

### Priority Order
Rules are evaluated in priority order (0 = highest priority). **The first matching rule determines the action.**

### Default Rules Explained

1. **Always Allow Favorites** (Priority 0)
   - Condition: Caller is in your favorites (starred contacts)
   - Action: Allow
   - Why: Safety - never block important people

2. **Block Unknown at Night** (Priority 1)
   - Condition: No caller ID + Time is 22:00-07:00
   - Action: Reject
   - Why: Block spam during sleep hours

3. **Block Hidden Numbers** (Priority 2)  
   - Condition: Caller ID is hidden
   - Action: Reject
   - Status: ‚ùå Disabled by default (you can enable it)

4. **Allow All Contacts** (Priority 3)
   - Condition: Caller is in your contacts
   - Action: Allow
   - Why: Allow known people through

### Example: Non-Favorite Calls You

**Scenario:** Someone in your contacts (but not favorited) calls at 11 PM

**Evaluation:**
1. Rule 0: Is in favorites? ‚ùå No ‚Üí Skip
2. Rule 1: No caller ID? ‚ùå No ‚Üí Skip
3. Rule 2: Disabled ‚Üí Skip
4. Rule 3: In contacts? ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí **ALLOW**

**Result:** Call rings normally

## üîß Creating Custom Rules

### Rule to Block All Non-Favorites
1. Tap "Manage Rules" ‚Üí "+" button
2. Name: "Block Non-Favorites"
3. Priority: 0 (make it highest)
4. Criteria:
   - Favorites Status: **Not in Favorites**
5. Action: **Reject**
6. Save

This will block ALL calls except from your favorite contacts!

### Rule for Business Hours Only
1. Name: "Allow Contacts During Business Hours"
2. Priority: 1
3. Criteria:
   - Contact Status: **In Contacts**
   - Days: Monday-Friday
   - Time: 09:00 - 17:00
4. Action: **Allow**

### Rule to Silence Unknown Callers
1. Name: "Silence Unknown"
2. Priority: 2
3. Criteria:
   - Contact Status: **Not in Contacts**
4. Action: **Silence**

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: Calls NOT Being Blocked

**Solution 1: Check Call Screening Role**
1. Open BusyRN
2. Look at home screen status
3. If it says "Protection Inactive", you need to set BusyRN as default
4. Go to Android Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Default apps ‚Üí Call screening app ‚Üí BusyRN

**Solution 2: Check Service Toggle**
1. On home screen, make sure the toggle is ON (green)
2. If it's grayed out, the Call Screening Role wasn't granted

**Solution 3: Check Rules**
1. Tap "Manage Rules"
2. Make sure at least one rule is enabled
3. Verify the rule matches your test scenario

**Solution 4: Check Permissions**
1. Tap "Permissions & Setup"
2. All 3 items should show "Granted"
3. If not, grant them

### Problem: Can't Find "Call Screening App" in Settings

Different Android versions have it in different places:

**Android 14:**
- Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Default apps ‚Üí Call screening app

**Android 13:**
- Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Default apps ‚Üí Phone app ‚Üí Call screening

**Android 12:**
- Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Default apps ‚Üí Call app

**Android 10-11:**
- Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Call settings ‚Üí Call blocking

**Can't find it?** Search "screening" or "default apps" in Android Settings

### Problem: Logs Not Showing

**Cause:** The app might not be screening calls yet

**Solution:**
1. Verify BusyRN is set as default (see above)
2. Make a test call
3. Pull down to refresh on the Call Logs screen

### Problem: All Calls Being Blocked

**Cause:** You might have a rule that's too broad

**Solution:**
1. Go to "Manage Rules"
2. Check your rules - especially Priority 0 (first to run)
3. Temporarily disable rules one by one to find the culprit
4. Make sure "Always Allow Favorites" is Priority 0 and ENABLED
